		<p>A message from the TGC team:<br>
		We are currently a 8 person startup trying to fundamentally change the way Americans interact with our government. There is a lot we are still in the process of preparing and some of the things we intend to bring to the site might be missing at the moment, so please keep that in mind as you go through our beta test phase. If you like what we are doing, become a part of the TGC family by: 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Helping us improve with feedback</li>
			<li>Be sure to check out our new features as they come</li>
			<li>Share TGC with anyone else that would like to become more politically involved</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Together we can raise the standard of American politics and we are just getting started.</p>

		<div id='works-wrapper1' class='section'>
			<h1>Data</h1>
			<p>Much of the political data available is a mess to sort through so TGC takes all of it and presents it in a way that is easy to read and comprehend. Thus we make this organized raw data available to users so that they may compare and create their own graphical analyses and conclusions as they so wish.<br> 
			But raw data is can still be arduous to access and all the data in the world means nothing if don’t know where to start looking. That’s why we aims to present this data in new, refreshing, and meaningful ways. So TGC offers a multitude of graphs, charts, and statistics created from this data, analyzing for its relatability, relevance, and the novelty of information it can provide. There are 3 main features that can be found for each piece of data - sources, context, and bias checks.</p>

			<h1>Surveys</h1>
			<p>Users are given optional surveys to personalize their experience with TGC. This allows you to stay up to date on issues that matter most to you. You can track personal changes and get to know yourself more. TGC also uses this for everyone to better understand TGC’s user base and to stay informed on other biases that may exist, e.g. population/selection bias, reporting bias. We keep surveys short and simple because they are meant to enhance your interactive experience, not be a time hinderance.</p>

		<div class='graphic_wrapper'><img src='/images/awlogo.png' class='graphic'></div>
		<div id='works-wrapper3' class='section'>
			<h1>Discussion</h1>
			<p>We provide a forum to discuss the data or add your own insights. We also link any websites, news outlets, bloggers that use our data in their articles, so that you can see how others are interpreting the data. You can also use our data or create your own graphs and statistics with the data any time to build your own arguments to be further posted, shared, and discussed.</p>

			<h1>How TGC Can Affect Government</h1>
			<p>We create an environment that promotes critical analysis of information. So when you form your own opinions, then discuss and share and take surveys to understand yourself to ultimately develop an informed position, you can change the way we approach government. By being informed you can challenge and demote misinformation caused by sensationalized media, poor data analysis, and lack of critical thinking in the realm of political reporting. By being informed you can hold your representatives accountable, contact them, and make sure your vote is going to what you really want come election day. By being informed, you can network and form coalitions through social media to show our representatives what the american people want. Together we can remove the ambiguity, fallacies, and blind bandwagoning from the debate to get to the heart of the issues and find productive solutions.</p>
