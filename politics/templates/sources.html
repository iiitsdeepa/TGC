			<h2>Our Data -Trusted, Comprehensive, Unbiased</h2>
			All of our data is thoroughly vetted and cross checked against multiple sources wherever possible. Data integrity is majorly important to us. Below are descriptions of the two main types of data we collect.

		<div id='ourdatatypes'>
			<div class='ourdatatype'>	
				<h3>Quantitative & Verifiable</h3>
				This is the main type of data we collect. It includes voting records, budgets, economic data, demographics, etc… This data is collected directly from the source. In the case of legislative data such as voting records or bills, we use the Sunlight Foundation’s API. All other data of this type comes directly from the government.

			<div class='ourdatatype'>
				<h3>Qualitative & Observational</h3>
				Data of this type is collected from reputable scholarly sources such as the Pew Research Center, or university based papers. We thoroughly vet each source and do not accept research that is demonstrably partisan
