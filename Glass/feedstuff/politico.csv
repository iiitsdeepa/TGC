                    "content": "<p>COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2013 A bruising, 48-point loss to Hillary Clinton in South Carolina Saturday night dramatically narrowed the path forward for Bernie Sanders, raising serious doubts about his ability to win the delegates needed to secure the Democratic nomination.</p><p>South Carolina will widen Clinton\u2019s delegate lead, currently at one after her Nevada win. But more significant, the contest here demonstrated that the Vermont senator has failed to make any headway at all with African-American voters in the South \u2013 even with 200 paid Sanders staffers on the ground and nearly $2 million in television spending, Clinton swept the black vote by a five-to-one ratio, according to  exit polls. Among black voters 65 and over, Clinton won by a stunning 96 to 3 percent.</p><p>\u201cWhen we stand together there is no barrier too big to break,\u201d Clinton said at her victory rally in Columbia, where she took the stage alone for the first time without Bill or Chelsea Clinton by her side. \u201cTomorrow, we take this campaign national.\u201d</p><p>Now, heading into Super Tuesday when 11 states will cast ballots on March 1, Sanders will face possibly insurmountable contests in Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Arkansas and Virginia, all states with sizable black populations and where he has not invested as much time or money.</p><br><p>\u201cDelegates determine the presidential nomination and I don\u2019t see a path for Sanders to get there,\u201d said Jeff Berman, a consultant to the Clinton campaign who ran Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 delegate strategy.</p><p>Running through a best-case scenario for Sanders, Clinton operatives said they expect Sanders could win Colorado, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Oklahoma and Vermont \u2013 states tailor-made for Sanders because they are caucus states, predominantly white states, New England states, or states with a history of electing progressives.</p><p>But even if Sanders manages to pull out significant wins in all five, the delegate math will make it difficult for Sanders to catch up \u2013 they represent only one-third of the delegates up for grabs on March 1. And the Clinton campaign has invested heavily in states like Colorado and Minnesota in order to limit Sanders\u2019 margins.</p><p>Sanders\u2019 operatives said they are looking beyond Super Tuesday, to the more friendly terrain of Kansas, Nebraska, and Maine to deliver them wins. But by then, Clinton operatives predicted, it could be too little too late to close the delegate gap.</p><p>\u201cOur delegate lead will only grow in the period after Super Tuesday,\u201d Berman said.</p><p>It\u2019s a similar situation to the one which Clinton found herself in eight years ago, when Obama established a delegate lead during 11 consecutive victories after Super Tuesday and she was never again able to catch up. In that race, Super Tuesday resulted in a colossal tie between Barack Obama and Clinton.</p><p>This year, however, it\u2019s on Super Tuesday that Clinton operatives expect to open up a wide lead of up to 50 delegates or more and leave Sanders behind for good.</p><p>\u201cSuper Tuesday in 2016 is not the same as in 2008, when the Democratic candidates fought to a draw,\u201d said Berman. \u201cThis year it is much more Southern dominated, heavily diverse with African American voters in many states and Hispanic voters in Texas. South Carolina is telling us how well Sanders can compete among these voters and how he\u2019ll perform in three days on Super Tuesday.\u201d</p><br><p>The states where Sanders is expected to win -- like his home state of Vermont -- don\u2019t give him the margins he needs to remain competitive. Vermont awards just 16 delegates, for example, compared to 222 awarded in Texas, where Sanders is not advertising on television and has spent little time campaigning over the past ten months.</p><p>But he started to make a push there on Saturday and showed he is still able to turnout Taylor Swift-sized crowds \u2013 more than 10,000 supporters turned out for his rally in Austin.</p><p>That grassroots support and his extraordinary small-donor fundraising juggernaut is what is expected to keep Sanders fighting through June.</p><p>\u201cWe tried to win Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada and we almost did,\u201d said Sanders\u2019 senior strategist Tad Devine. \u201cWhen it was clear that wasn\u2019t going to happen, we took a much longer view of this. Our view extends to the middle of March. We\u2019re in sprint mode.\u201d</p><p>Devine admitted that the results in South Carolina indicate the campaign has a difficult task ahead in terms of winning over black voters.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve tried hard in South Carolina,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s an important first step in a long process of introducing him to the African-American community all across the country and build support. That\u2019s going to take time, though.\u201d</p><p>The problem for Sanders is that time is running out. The next real battleground contest will take place on March 8 in Michigan, where Clinton has been making Flint a centerpiece of her campaign. </p><p>A win there would be symbolically important for Sanders, because of the outsized role Flint has played in Clinton\u2019s campaign. But Clinton operatives noted that Mississippi, which votes on the same day and where Clinton is expected to win, would allow them to win more delegates even if Sanders takes Michigan.</p><br><p>Sanders\u2019 campaign expects that the Vermonter\u2019s personal story -- he is the son of Polish immigrants -- will resonate more deeply with Latino voters. And Devine said the campaign will fight to win New York, where Clinton served as senator for eight years, because Sanders\u2019 has roots in Brooklyn and upstate New York shares a small media market with Burlington, so he is more well known.</p><p>But for now, Clinton allies who expect that he will plow on through June are feeling friendlier toward the candidate whose popularity and attacks on the former president have been making Bill Clinton furious. Instead of calling on Sanders to drop out any time soon, they are attempting to tone down the rhetoric of the campaign so Sanders doesn\u2019t escalate his attacks on Clinton and soften her up ahead of a general election.</p><p>\u201cBernie is running a great campaign,\u201d said longtime Clinton ally Paul Begala, who now advises Clinton\u2019s super PAC, Priorities USA. \u201cHe\u2019s raising money, he\u2019s building crowds, I don\u2019t want him to go away. He\u2019s making Hillary a better candidate. And he\u2019s not running an insult-based campaign. I don&#39;t want it to end.&quot;</p><br>",

                    "content": "<p>Super Tuesday could cripple every Republican presidential candidate not named Donald Trump.</p><p>The best-case scenario for Trump would put him far ahead of his rivals in the race for delegates, and polls have him competitive almost everywhere that Republicans are voting. But even if he stumbles, Trump will leave Super Tuesday with enough delegates to remain at the front of the race.</p><p>Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Ben Carson all lack that luxury. Rubio revived establishment hopes with an aggressive debate performance on Thursday, but a weak finish this week would leave him hobbled heading into his must-win home state of Florida on March 15. Cruz is hoping his brand of conservatism will resonate in the seven Southern states that will dole out the largest share of delegates, but polls show Trump uncomfortably close even in Texas, where Cruz allies admit a loss would be disastrous. Kasich is holding out for Ohio later in March, but if he doesn\u2019t outperform his polls, he\u2019ll struggle to make the case that he\u2019s a national candidate. And even Carson\u2019s allies are suggesting that, barring a miracle, Super Tuesday is likely the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/ben-carson-exit-republican-candidates-219669\"><u>end of the line</u></a>.</p><p>About 600 delegates are up for grabs, more than a quarter of all delegates that will be handed out throughout the primary. Though every state is required by party rules to divide those delegates proportionally, rules setting minimum thresholds could end up shutting out Cruz or Rubio if they fall even narrowly short.</p><br><p>Here's a breakdown of each Super Tuesday state and the dynamics in play: </p><p><b>Alabama primary; 50 delegates</b></p><p>Don't be fooled by Gov. Robert Bentley's endorsement of his colleague Kasich. This is conservative country. It's the home of immigration hard-liner Jeff Sessions, whose endorsement has been courted by both Cruz and Trump. There have been few polls of the largely rural state, but Trump dominated the most recent one, a December <a href=\"http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2016/01/poll_shows_trump_and_cruz_in_l.html\"><u>poll</u></a> funded by state lawmakers that showed Trump with a 20-point edge over Cruz. </p><p>Brent Buchanan, an unaligned Republican strategist in Alabama, said he expects the state to mirror the results of South Carolina: a strong Trump win and a Rubio second-place finish. Buchanan noted that Rubio just earned the endorsement of 31 state lawmakers and that Cruz pulled out of an Alabama forum Saturday, which Rubio attended. Anecdotally, he said, energy for Cruz has slid. It could leave Cruz empty-handed if he fails to reach 20 percent support in the state, the minimum threshold for receiving delegates.</p><p><b>Alaska caucuses; 28 delegates</b></p><p>The Alaska caucuses are virtually invisible. The low-population state is so far out of the way, few candidates devoted much time there. One potential factor: Sarah Palin. A longtime Cruz ally, Palin endorsed Trump last month. In a small state like Alaska, where Palin was governor before her vice presidential run in 2008, an endorsement could carry weight. The only <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/article/20160123/adn-poll-alaskans-trump-sanders-president\"><u>poll</u></a> that included Trump, taken in early January, showed a close race between the mogul and Cruz.</p><p><b>Arkansas primary; 40 delegates</b></p><p>One of the few obvious opportunities on the map for non-Trump candidates is here. The only recent <a href=\"http://talkbusiness.net/2016/02/poll-hillary-clinton-ted-cruz-hold-leads-in-democratic-gop-presidential-primaries/\"><u>poll</u></a> shows Cruz with a narrow lead and a second-place tie between Trump and Rubio. Rubio is the beneficiary of a recent endorsement by Gov. Asa Hutchinson, part of a wave of establishment support he received after Jeb Bush dropped out of the race. Trump has spent time here, though. He held a rally shortly before the New Hampshire primary and he returned Saturday for a rally in Bentonville. He also recently hired Sarah Huckabee, daughter of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, as a senior communications adviser.</p><p><b>Georgia primary; 76 delegates</b></p><p>Trump holds massive leads over his rivals in recent polls of Georgia, the second-largest prize on Super Tuesday. It may be the reason that Trump will spend Monday in Valdosta. The state also has a 20 percent support threshold for doling out delegates, a dangerous dynamic for Cruz and Rubio, who have both floated around that level in recent polls. Rubio recently opened his first office in the state; Trump and Cruz have had a presence there for a while.</p><p><b>Massachusetts primary; 42 delegates</b></p><p>Trump is poised to<a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/1/files/2016/02/Topline-2016-02-WBUR-MA-Republican-Primary.pdf\"> <u>run away</u></a> with a win in Massachusetts. The main question is by how much. A resounding victory that features buy-in from the state's significant contingent of blue-collar, Reagan Democrat/independent voters is already spooking Democrats about Trump's strength for the general election. It's also bad news for Kasich, whose team and supporters hoped his second-place finish in New Hampshire would come with Massachusetts coattails. Kasich is expected to get crushed in the South and hasn't had the resources to build much of an organization, so he's been counting on victories on less conservative turf to carry him through Super Tuesday. He won't find much shelter here though. He will, however, likely pick up a few delegates. The state distributes delegates to any candidate who receives more than 5 percent of the vote.</p><br><p><b>Minnesota caucuses; 38 delegates</b></p><p>The only Midwestern state on the calendar Tuesday, Minnesota will be a true wild card. Trump<a href=\"http://www.mprnews.org/story/2016/01/28/trump-wild-card-minnesota-gop-presidential-caucuses\"> <u>reportedly</u></a> has limited organization in the state, and the most recent<a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/rubio-clinton-take-early-lead-in-star-tribune-minnesota-poll/366314221/\"> <u>poll</u></a> there  puts Rubio and Cruz in a statistical tie with Trump. That might explain Rubio's recent visit there. He's in search of any state in which to notch an outright win so that he's not swept on Super Tuesday, as he was in the early states. Rubio received endorsements last week from two prominent Minnesota Republicans, former Gov. Tim Pawlenty and former Sen. Norm Coleman. Trump didn't schedule any time in Minnesota over the past week, as he barnstormed the South.</p><p>State GOP chairman Keith Downey said Minnesota is one of the few mysteries on the map. He&#39;s urged party officials to prepare for up to twice their record-level turnout of 2008. &quot;I think Cruz, Rubio and Trump might be a little more bunched together in Minnesota, similar to Iowa,&quot; he said. Downey added that Trump, of late, has begun assembling a field team that could help him corral more votes on Tuesday.</p><p><b>Oklahoma primary; 43 delegates</b></p><p>Oklahoma is looking like the \u201cbragging rights\u201d state. That\u2019s the way party Chairwoman Pam Pollard sees it. Pollard noted that Oklahoma, one of the three most conservative states in the country, also holds the first totally \u201cclosed\u201d primaries \u2014 meaning only voters who registered as Republicans by Feb. 5 can cast ballots. Earlier states and even other Super Tuesday states allow some crossover voting by Democrats or voting by independents.</p><p>That means the winner in Oklahoma can demonstrate he won a state in which only \u201cRepublicans voted for Republicans.\u201d That might explain the late flurry of activity in the state. Trump was in Oklahoma City on Friday, and Pollard said Rubio would be in the state for two stops on Monday. Cruz, she said, had visited three times and would be back again before Tuesday\u2019s primary.</p><p>Polls have shown Trump holding a solid but potentially surmountable lead. The Oklahoman<a href=\"http://newsok.com/poll-trump-leads-in-oklahoma-days-before-super-tuesday/article/5480910\"> <u>poll</u></a> put Trump ahead with 29 percent support to Rubio's 21 percent. According to the State Elections Board, as of Friday afternoon,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/OKelections/status/703294069053632512\"> <u>mail-in absentee ballots</u></a> in Oklahoma hit 13,600, already significantly outpacing the 10,500 in 2012, and<a href=\"https://twitter.com/OKelections/status/703293920319373312\"> <u>early voting</u></a> hit 15,700, already beating 2012's 14,500.</p><p><b>Tennessee primary; 58 delegates</b></p><p>The state -- whose elongated geography drew candidates due to its overlap with media markets in a slew of surrounding states -- is something of an ideological mystery. The state's governor, Bill Haslam, was reelected resoundingly in 2014, but he drew ire from conservatives during a failed attempt to expand Medicaid. Haslam endorsed Rubio last week. A Middle Tennessee State University<a href=\"http://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/A8DZo/1/\"> <u>poll</u></a> taken in mid-January showed Trump lapping the field with 33 percent to Cruz's 17 percent, though more than a quarter of voters were still undecided.</p><p><b>Texas primary; 155 delegates</b></p><p>This is must-win turf for Cruz. In fact, anything other than a huge victory would be a problem for his campaign. Cruz's path to the nomination revolves around dominance in the South, starting in his home state. If he doesn't come away from Super Tuesday with a delegate lead, it will raise enormous questions about his viability going forward. Absent that kind of showing, his best hope may be a divided electorate that sends the contest to a floor fight at the July convention. Cruz has shown strength in recent polls, leading by double digits in a new Monmouth University survey.</p><p>The state party requires a 20 percent threshold of support for candidates to receive delegates. Trump and Cruz may be the only two who come away with delegates if current polling trends hold.</p><br><p><b>Vermont primary; 16 delegates</b></p><p>With the tiniest pot of delegates up for grabs Tuesday, Vermont hasn\u2019t gotten much attention. But Trump did hold a rally there in January, and Kasich has argued that, like Massachusetts, this generally liberal state could be a pickup opportunity for a more moderate candidate. The state\u2019s only recent<a href=\"http://digital.vpr.net/post/vpr-poll-races-issues-and-full-results#stream/0\"> <u>poll</u></a> tells a different story. Trump is dominant and trailed distantly by a second-place Rubio. If these results, and those in a Massachusetts poll, hold, Kasich could come away winless on the day. The state doles out delegates only to candidates who earn 20 percent support or more \u2014 meaning Trump could shut out his rivals if he holds his large lead.</p><p><b>Virginia primary; 49 delegates</b></p><p>Donald Trump held a double-digit lead over Rubio and Cruz  in recent<a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/va/virginia_republican_presidential_primary-3921.html\"> <u>polls</u></a> of the state. But the state's impact will be diluted because it doesn't have a delegate threshold, ensuring that even lower-performing candidates will come away with a share of delegates. Kasich made three stops in Virginia last week, and his team has cast Virginia as a state where he could prove sneaky-strong, but polls don't bear that out. A Roanoke College<a href=\"http://www.roanoke.edu/about/news/rc_poll_feb_2016_va_primary_elections\"> <u>poll</u></a> out Friday gives Trump a 23-point edge over Cruz, who is statistically tied with Rubio. Carson and Kasich lag the field with just 8 percent support apiece.</p><p><b>Wyoming convention; 29 delegates</b></p><p>No drama here. Wyoming will send its 29 delegates to the July convention unbound. It holds no presidential preference poll or vote of any kind, a distinction shared by only North Dakota and Guam. If the Republican convention becomes a first-ballot nail-biter, these unbound delegates could help tip the balance.</p><br>",

                    "content": "<p>In state after state, the pattern is the same. </p><p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s team swooped in early, organized methodically and captured support from the Democratic establishment. Bernie Sanders arrived late, opened eyes with a few jam-packed rallies and quickly generated a ground game powered by the progressive grass roots. </p><p> In the end, Sanders\u2019 chances in the 11 states that vote on Tuesday hinge on demographics. The higher the African-American share of the electorate \u2014 the group with which Sanders has most struggled to make inroads, even as he gained popularity within the Democratic Party over the past year \u2014 the lower the odds of a Sanders victory. </p><p>Here is POLITICO\u2019s guide to the Super Tuesday Democratic landscape. </p><p><b>Alabama: 53 delegates</b></p><p>There\u2019s been almost no public polling ahead of Alabama\u2019s Democratic primary. We do have a key number, though: 51 percent. That was the black share of the 2008 primary vote, according to exit polls, and Clinton is expected to dominate among those voters just as she did in South Carolina.</p><p>The one recent poll \u2014 a mid-February Public Policy Polling survey \u2014 put Clinton ahead by 28 percentage points, driven by a 3-to-1 edge among African-Americans. Clinton also has a critical endorsement from the influential Alabama Democratic Conference, the African-American wing of the state party, and she got a big head start on the ground. She is likely to roll up a comfortable win.</p><p><b>Arkansas: 32 delegates</b></p><p>Move along. There\u2019s nothing to see here.</p><p>Bill Clinton\u2019s native state, where he served as governor and Hillary Clinton served as first lady for years, is expected to deliver the Clintons another healthy victory on Tuesday. Arkansas Democrats still feel connected to the Clinton family decades after they moved out of the governor\u2019s mansion, in part because the former president still visits frequently.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer here,\u201d state Democratic Party chairman Vincent Insalaco <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/bernie-bears-down-for-super-tuesday-surprise-219761\">said</a> recently. \u201cIt\u2019s not even a question.\u201d</p><p><b>Colorado: 66 delegates</b></p><p>The caucus format, which often rewards intensity of support and insurgent campaigns, creates one of Sanders\u2019 best chances to notch a Super Tuesday victory and maintain some momentum. An October mega-rally in Boulder drew an enormous crowd and was one of the first moments in which it became clear Sanders\u2019 campaign was tapping into something deep. </p><p>He has since committed significant time and resources in Colorado, outspending the Clinton campaign more than 2-to-1 on TV. The electorate is significantly whiter than in the Southern states that vote at the same time, and Sanders\u2019 performance in Nevada suggests he can be competitive with Hispanic voters in the West. </p><p>But Clinton is fighting hard for the state too, even though it has twice stung her: once when Jerry Brown defeated her husband in 1992 and again when Barack Obama walloped her in the 2008 caucuses. This year, Clinton has most of the state\u2019s top Democratic officials in her camp. And with opportunity comes risk for Sanders \u2014 a Clinton victory here would be a major blow for Sanders\u2019 campaign. </p><p><b>Georgia: 102 delegates</b></p><p>Sanders attracted a big crowd to a recent event held at Morehouse College in Atlanta, part of his campaign tour of historic black colleges and universities. He even predicted a Super Tuesday victory, noting how far his Georgia campaign had come. </p><p>If only.</p><p>Sanders doesn\u2019t break 30 percent in any recent polls of one of the biggest, delegate-rich prizes on the Super Tuesday map. The African-American share of the Democratic electorate was more than 50 percent in 2008; according to one recent survey, the Vermont senator was getting blown out among black voters, 70 percent to 14 percent.</p><p><b>Massachusetts: 91 delegates</b></p><p>Vermont\u2019s southern neighbor is one of a handful of states in which Sanders\u2019 Super Tuesday outlook is promising. </p><p>He has strong grass-roots support in Massachusetts, and Sanders may also reap some reward from the $5.2 million he spent on Boston TV during the New Hampshire primary. Clinton has the backing of most of the state\u2019s top elected officials \u2014 though the biggest name in Massachusetts Democratic politics, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, has not endorsed either candidate. </p><p>Yet for all of Sanders\u2019 relative advantages in Massachusetts compared with other March 1 states, the three most recent polls in the state show a very tight race. Sanders led by 5 percentage points in one; Clinton led by 5 points in another; and a third poll showed a dead heat. </p><p><b>Minnesota: 77 delegates</b></p><p>With its caucus system and relatively big delegate haul, Minnesota is central to Sanders\u2019 Super Tuesday strategy. He\u2019s drawn huge crowds in the Twin Cities area \u2014 and he flew to Rochester for a big rally Saturday night as he was getting routed in South Carolina\u2019s primary. Sanders\u2019 campaign sees the state and its progressive, largely white electorate as right in the senator\u2019s sweet spot. </p><p>The Clinton operation recognized his strength in Minnesota and has moved aggressively to counter him; both campaigns, which have vigorous operations in the state, have filled the airwaves with ads. </p><p>This is one of two key states to watch \u2014 Colorado is the other \u2014 when gauging Sanders\u2019 Super Tuesday performance. If he can\u2019t win here, in caucuses that were carried by Tom Harkin in 1992 and were kind to Jesse Jackson in 1988 and Dennis Kucinich in 2004, it\u2019s probably not going to be a very good day for the Vermont senator.</p><p><b>Oklahoma: 38 delegates</b></p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2015/March2016PrimariesPollingProject.pdf\">most recent public survey</a> in Oklahoma showed Clinton\u2019s lead over Sanders within the margin of error \u2014 and state Democratic officials agree the race is tight.</p><p>That same poll suggests Sanders\u2019 anti-Wall Street, income-inequality message has resonated in Oklahoma to a much greater degree than in neighboring Arkansas and Texas. There was evidence of that Wednesday in Tulsa, where Sanders attracted nearly 7,000 people to a rally.</p><p>Sanders has also owned the airwaves here: He has more than doubled Clinton\u2019s spending on TV, cable and radio. </p><p><b>Tennessee: 67 delegates</b></p><p>Sanders has barely given Tennessee a look. He hasn\u2019t spent any ad money here and hasn\u2019t even visited. The sparse polling in the state suggests why: Clinton has a big lead in the state, especially among African-American Democrats, who cast more than a quarter of the vote in the 2008 primary. </p><p><b>Texas: 252 delegates</b></p><p>In 2008, Democratic turnout tripled over 2004 and Hillary Clinton captured a must-win victory powered by women, Latinos and rural whites. And this time around, she\u2019s poised to win Texas by a much bigger margin than 4 percentage points. </p><p>There have been seven public polls in the state in February, and the RealClearPolitics polling average puts the spread between Clinton and Sanders at 26 percentage points. The latest poll, from Monmouth University, is especially grim for Sanders in the biggest delegate prize to date: Clinton leads 81-8 percent among African-Americans, 75-19 percent among women and 68-32 percent among Latinos. </p><p><b>Vermont: 16 delegates</b></p><p>Even if everything else goes wrong for Sanders on Tuesday, his home state will deliver: He\u2019s capturing more than 80 percent of the vote, according to the two most recent polls.</p><p>That\u2019s despite resistance from the state\u2019s top Democratic leaders, many of whom are supporting Clinton. But the grass roots appear to be firmly behind their junior senator.</p><p><b>Virginia: 95 delegates</b></p><p>Clinton has led Sanders by double digits in Virginia in every poll taken this year. She\u2019s powered in part by support from African-Americans, who cast 30 percent of the vote in 2008, and Clinton also has a powerful friend, Gov. Terry McAuliffe, in her corner. </p><p>There\u2019s some thought that Sanders might do well in populous Northern Virginia, but even if so, it\u2019s probably not enough to help him carry a large state where he hasn\u2019t even been up on TV. </p><p><i>Hanna Trudo contributed to this report.</i></p><br>",

                    "content": "<p>CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2013 Saturday was the best night of Hillary Clinton\u2019s political life \u2013 a crushing, better-than-expected rout that just might have cracked the back of Bernie Sanders\u2019 momentum-driven insurgency.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to believe that barely a month ago, Clinton\u2019s staff were ruefully refreshing their screens in disbelief as her lead in Iowa shrunk from two, to one, to one-half to the ultimate hairsbreadth victory margin of 0.2 percent. From the minute the polls closed here on Saturday night, Clinton\u2019s lead vacillated from insane to incomprehensible, settling in at 47 percent, double what most polls had predicted.</p><p>This is what a wave looks like \u2013 she won black voters by a jaw-dropping 87-to-13 percent margin and dominated with all but the youngest voters \u2013 reinforcing her campaign\u2019s argument that the Vermont senator is a no-sale in anything but the whitest, smallest or most liberal states.</p><p>The Palmetto massacre, coupled with Clinton\u2019s surprisingly strong six-point win in Nevada last week, doesn\u2019t spell instant doom for the Vermont senator (who has parlayed his anti-Wall Street message into online-donor gold). But it has, more or less, reset the race to where it began last summer, with the former secretary of state as the odds-on favorite to win her party\u2019s nomination.</p><p>With that in mind, here are five takeaways. </p><p><b>It might be over. </b>Sanders is still a viable candidate \u2013 with the capacity to raise millions online in a few hours \u2013 but he\u2019s fast falling victim to the merciless electoral math that doomed Clinton in 2008. His strength with younger voters provided the rocket fuel for his rise this winter \u2013 but his weakness with blacks and Hispanics is likely to sink him in the spring. </p><p>He trails Clinton by 50 to 60 points among African-American voters \u2013 and he\u2019s likely to be obliterated, like he was Saturday night, in the six delegate-rich Super Tuesday states where black voters represent 40 to 60 percent of the primary electorate - Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Texas, Virginia and Tennessee. Clinton\u2019s current lead in Virginia and Texas \u2013 which account for a combined 363 delegates \u2013 ranges from 17 to 30 percent. </p><p>Sanders\u2019 campaign has basically conceded those states \u2013 while pouring resources into Oklahoma, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Colorado, and Vermont; He could win most or all of those states, but the polling (outside of his home state) is pretty close, so he\u2019s likely to eke out only a few extra delegates. And these would be Clinton \u201908-type victories: They look good on a press release, but are a wash when it comes to delegates \u2013 and Clinton continues to run the table when it comes to establishment-loyal super delegates. </p><p>Then comes March 15: Current polling shows Clinton leading by roughly 25 points in the winner-take-all Florida primaries, another 246 delegates there. Tad Devine, Sanders\u2019 top strategist, told me last week that Michigan was the \u201clinchpin\u201d of his campaign\u2019s strategy \u2013 but recent polls there show Clinton up by high-teens to more than 30 points. </p><p>Barring some unforeseen sea change, it\u2019s hard to see a path for a momentum-driven candidate who has just lost the biggest state yet to vote by nearly 50 points.</p><p><b>The Trump Effect? </b>Call Mexicans rapists, suggest you\u2019ll support judges who roll back civil rights laws (while saying super sensitive stuff like \u201cthe African-Americans love me\u201d), spend years demanding to see the first black president\u2019s already-produced birth certificate and allegedly forged college records \u2013 oh, and retweet white supremacists on Twitter \u2013 and guess what? </p><p>Overall turnout was way down in South Carolina from the high stakes Obama-vs.-Clinton primary in 2008 -- in part because polls have been predicting a Clinton landslide for weeks and Democratic turnout has been lagging in a less-than-scintillating Clinton-Sanders contest all over the country.</p><p>But a record percentage of black voters in South Carolina turned out on Saturday \u2013 62 percent of the Democratic electorate. That might be a function of white voters sitting it out - but recent polls suggest that black and Hispanic voters feel under siege and are more energized this year than in the past \u2013 and Clinton has a decisive advantage with both groups.</p><p>Clinton\u2019s strategy increasingly involves looking past Sanders to the bellicose developer-turned-reality TV star. \u201cDespite what you hear, we don&#39;t need to make America great again,\u201d she said, mocking Trump\u2019s campaign slogan. \u201cAmerica has never stopped being great. But we do need to make America whole again.&quot;</p><p><b>Heal the Bern.</b> Hillary Clinton\u2019s big win here (coupled with her race-changing victory in Nevada last week) gives her time to solve some of the more vexing problems of the campaign \u2013 messaging, online fundraising, etc. \u2013 but it can\u2019t remedy her worst ill, a congenital inability to connect with younger voters that first plagued her in \u201808. Democratic operatives, Clinton allies and staffers think she can\u2019t do much to alter the dynamic in the primaries (although she did much better with under-50 blacks here than with younger whites in Iowa and New Hampshire). But there\u2019s an obvious answer in the general election: An electrifying 74-year-old democratic socialist who brought her to the brink with his anti-Wall Street, anti-her crusade.</p><p>The battle against Sanders has been a bitter one, closely following Team Obama\u2019s 2012 strategy against Mitt Romney in 2012 \u2013 define your opponent early and often; Democrats relentlessly tagged Romney as an out-of-touch rich guy and Clinton\u2019s aides have gone all Brooklyn on Bernie, consistently labeling him a \u201cone-issue\u201d candidate who couldn\u2019t hope to pass the commander-in-chief test. (Sanders has reciprocated by walloping Clinton for her Wall Street ties and plutocratic speaking fees.) There are tests yet to come \u2013 and Sanders could mount a comeback on Super Tuesday and there\u2019s always the latent email scandal \u2013 but expect Clinton to soften her tone with the Vermont senator: Youth must be served, even if a septuagenarian is the waiter.</p><p>Take this olive branch from happy Clinton warrior Paul Begala (via my colleague Annie Karni): &quot;I don\u2019t want him to go away. He\u2019s exciting young people, which is a vital part, he\u2019s making Hillary a better candidate,\u201d he said.</p><p><b>White is Wrong. </b>If he loses<b>, </b>Sanders\u2019 failure to counter Clinton\u2019s dominance with black voters will likely be remembered as a fatal flaw in an otherwise inspirational and brilliantly executed campaign. While he was hammering away at his core issue of income inequality \u2013 which he viewed as a fundamental societal flaw that undermined African-American progress \u2013 the Clinton campaign was, ever so cleverly, undermining him with black voters week after week after week. </p><p>Seemingly broad policy attacks on Sanders\u2019 position on gun control and other issues served double-duty as a dog whistle in a community decimated by gun violence. But it was Sanders\u2019 inability to understand how his criticism of President Obama \u2013 often mild and respectful \u2013 served to sour his relationship with black voters who are deeply invested in his legacy and keenly suspicious of white politicians who don\u2019t give the president his due. </p><p>Clinton masterfully painted Sanders\u2019 career-long advocacy for single-payer, government-funded health care as an attack on Obamacare \u2013 and he made a major blunder by offhandedly suggesting the former first lady was embracing Obama\u2019s achievements simply to win black votes. \u201cI think that a lot of people resented that,\u201d the Rev. Al Sharpton told me in an interview last week.</p><p>He\u2019s still drawing the crowds \u2013 a biracial rally in Chicago earlier this week drew more than 6,000 people. But another event, held at an historically black college in Orangeburg yesterday, drew dozens of people at a gym that holds hundreds. </p><p><b>Bubba, redeemed. </b>Bill Clinton has the worst poker face in politics \u2013 and his relaxed, (mostly) happy-go-lucky tour of western South Carolina this week had a joyful, triumphant quality utterly absent from his bitter battles on the rope lines of Charleston, Columbia and Spartanburg eight years ago.</p><p>In 2008, he wagged a bony, disapproving finger when a pack of us reporters asked if he thought the Obama campaign was playing \u201cthe race card\u201d here \u2013 and he rasped \u201cShame on you!\u201d in our direction even though we were an innately shameless lot. Recrimination has yielded to relief in 2016 \u2013 the black voters who abandoned the Clintons have flocked back, and few even remember a humiliating loss that has lingered with the former \u201cfirst black president\u201d for years. </p><p>When I accosted him on a rope line in the Charlotte suburb of Rock Hill a few days ago, he smiled and clutched my forearm when I asked if he was having more fun this time around. \u201cI feel good, we both feel good. It feels good, like I\u2019ve come home,\u201d he said \u2013 and the voters proved him right.</p><br>",
