Attendees who were promised a personal photo with Trump received only the chance to take a photo with a cardboard cutout. And many instructors were bankrupt real estate investors.</p>\n<p>Trump University emerged as a campaign issue at Thursday\u2019s GOP debate, raised by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are people who borrowed $36,000 to go to Trump University, and they\u2019re suing now \u2014 $36,000 to go to a university that\u2019s a fake school,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAnd you know what they got?

He\u2019s Hispanic \u2014 which is fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Curiel is a judge in the Southern District of California and based in San Diego.</p>\n<p>New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, whose office has filed a separate civil $40 million complaint against Trump University in state court, accused Trump of \u201cracial demagoguery.\u201d Schneiderman sued Trump University in 2013 alleging it committed fraud and fleeced 5,000 people out of millions of dollars.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will not engage in a debate about ongoing litigation,\u201d Schneiderman said in a statement issued after Trump made his comments. \u201cBut there is no place in this process for racial demagoguery directed at respected members of the judiciary.\u201d</p>\n<p>Schneiderman noted that New York\u2019s state Supreme Court ruled that Trump University operated illegally in New York as an unlicensed educational institution. His suit alleges that Trump University falsely promoted itself as an educational institution even after the state education department warned it to stop. The complaint accuses Trump of falsely promising that Trump University students would receive intense training from experts hand-picked by Trump himself.</p>\n<p>During breaks in the seminars, Schneiderman\u2019s complaint alleges, participants were urged to call their credit card companies and ask to increase their credit limits. Once the credit lines were secured, Trump University staff tried to persuade students to pay for additional services.</p>\n<p>Trump, at the rally, dismissed the cases as the work of \u201ca sleazebag law firm\u201d and suggested that Schneiderman\u2019s intervention was politically motivated.</p>\n<p>\u201cI could\u2019ve settled this suit numerous times.

But Ahmed himself was unrepentant and some parliamentarians were openly supportive of the attack.</p>\n<p>\u201cI delivered the Egyptian people\u2019s message, and Egyptian martyrs, and the Palestinian people\u2019s rights, and our historical symbols such as Gamal Abdel Nasser,\u201d Ahmed told the YouTube channel Parlamany, which tracks Egyptian parliamentary affairs.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs a parliamentarian and as an Egyptian citizen, I think that Kamal Ahmed\u2019s shoe will enter history books, and that it represents the Egyptian people\u2019s rejection to normalization with Israel,\u201d said MP Osama Sharshar in an interview with Parlamany.</p>\n<p>Egypt has full diplomatic relations with Israel, but directly dealing with Israelis remains deeply taboo in Egyptian society even after the two countries signed the 1979 U.S.-sponsored peace treaty.</p>\n<p>Following the shoe beating, Okasha spoke with the Parlamany channel saying of Ahmed, \u201cIf he hit me 30 times with a shoe on my head, he is still like my father.\u201d</p>\n<p>Okasha said he met with Koren in order to serve Egypt\u2019s interests. That included a discussion of Ethiopia\u2019s under-construction Grand Renaissance Dam. Cairo fears the dam may cut into Egypt\u2019s vital share of the Nile waters.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey (Israel) are the ones building the Renaissance Dam, are we fooling ourselves?\u201d Okasha asked, making reference to a widely-believed conspiracy theory that Israel is supporting Ethiopia\u2019s dam in an attempt to harm Egypt\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p>Emmanuel Nahshon, spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, said the meeting had taken place at Okasha\u2019s invitation.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe importance of the meeting was in the fact that it took place,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Koren spoke with Israeli Army Radio Sunday morning before the shoe assault, saying he would meet again with the Okasha, if invited, despite the uproar.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis will continue, of course, because we pledged to keep talking about the issues and attempts to promote them,\u201d Koren said. \u201cIt is possible that we will also manage to get some positive results from this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Okasha had announced a week before the meeting took place on TV that he had invited the ambassador to have dinner with him at his home.</p>\n<p>Okasha\u2019s meeting with Koren has been heavily discussed on public affairs shows, and MENA reports the parliament on Sunday decided to form a special committee to investigate the meeting.</p>\n<p>Read more stories from TheBlaze</p><p><p><a rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Ex-CIA, NSA Head: If \u2018President Trump\u2019 Implements Certain Campaign Promises, U.S. Military \u2018Would Refuse to Act\u2019\" href=\"http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2016/02/27/ex-cia-nsa-head-if-president-trump-implements-certain-campaign-promises-u-s-military-would-refuse-to-act/\">Ex-CIA, NSA Head: If \u2018President Trump\u2019 Implements Certain Campaign Promises, U.S. Military \u2018Would Refuse to Act\u2019</a></p><p><a rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Marco Rubio Continues Verbal Assault on Donald Trump \u2014 You Don\u2019t Want to Miss His Nickname for Trump\u2019s Jet\" href=\"http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2016/02/27/marco-rubio-continues-verbal-assault-on-donald-trump-you-dont-want-to-miss-his-nickname-for-trumps-jet/\">Marco Rubio Continues Verbal Assault on Donald Trump \u2014 You Don\u2019t Want to Miss His Nickname for Trump\u2019s Jet</a></p><p><a rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Fox News Plays Rubio Clips of Trump Mocking Him.
