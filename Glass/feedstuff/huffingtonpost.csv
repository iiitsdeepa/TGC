                    "content": "<br> <p>BAGHDAD, Feb 28 (Reuters) - A twin suicide bombing claimed by Islamic State killed 70 people in a Shi'ite district of Baghdad on Sunday in the deadliest attack inside the capital this year, as militants launched an assault on its western outskirts.</p><br> <p>Police sources said the suicide bombers were riding motorcycles and blew themselves up in a crowded mobile phone market in Sadr City, wounding more than 100 people in addition to the dead.</p><br> <p>A Reuters witness saw pools of blood on the ground with slippers, shoes and mobile phones at the site of the blasts, which was sealed off to prevent further attacks.</p><br> <p>In a statement circulated online, Islamic State said it was responsible for the blasts: \"Our swords will not cease to cut off the heads of the rejectionist polytheists, wherever they are,\" it said, using derogatory terms for Shi'ite Muslims.</p><br> <p>Iraqi forces backed by airstrikes from a U.S.-led coalition have driven Islamic State back in the western Anbar province recently and are preparing for an offensive to retake the northern city of Mosul.</p><br> <p>But the militants are still able to strike outside territory they control, often targeting members of Iraq's Shi'ite majority, most recently on Thursday when two Islamic State suicide bombers killed 15 people at a mosque in the capital.</p><br> <p>Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said the attacks were in response to Islamic State's recent defeats: \"This gang targeted civilians after it lost the initiative and its dregs fled the battlefield before our proud fighters,\" he said on his official Facebook page.</p><br> <p>At dawn on Sunday, suicide bombers and gunmen attacked Iraqi security forces in Abu Ghraib, seizing positions in a grain silo and a cemetery, and killing at least 17 members of the security forces, officials said.</p><br> <p>Security officials blamed Islamic State, and a news agency that supports the group said it had launched a \"wide attack\" in Abu Ghraib, 25 km (15 miles) from the center of Baghdad and next to the international airport.</p><br> <p>Footage circulated online by the Amaq news agency appeared to show Islamic State fighters crouching behind dirt berms and launching the attack with automatic rifles, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. Reuters could not verify the video's authenticity.</p><br> <p>Security forces had mostly regained control by Sunday evening but officials said there were still clashes.</p><br> <p>Baghdad-based security analyst Jasim al-Bahadli said the assault suggested it was premature to declare that Islamic State was losing the initiative in Iraq.</p><br> <p>\"Government forces must do a better job repelling attacks launched by Daesh. What happened today could be a setback for the security forces,\" he said, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State.</p><br> <br> <p>\u00a0</p><br> <p><strong>COUNTER OFFENSIVE</strong></p><br> <p>Army and police sources said the militants had attacked from the nearby Islamic State-controlled areas of Garma and Falluja, driving Humvees and pickup trucks fixed with machine guns.</p><br> <p>A curfew was imposed as a regiment of Iraq's elite counter-terrorism forces was mobilized to retake the silo in Abu Ghraib and prevent the militants approaching the nearby airport, security officials said.</p><br> <p>Iraqi army helicopters bombarded Islamic State positions in the and Interior Ministry spokesman Brigadier General Saad Maan said at least 20 militants had been killed in the government's counter offensive.</p><br> <p>Fighters from the Hashid Shaabi, a coalition of mainly Iranian-backed Shi'ite militias, were mobilized to Abu Ghraib to reinforce regular government forces in the area, said Jawad al-Tulaibawi, a local Hashid commander.</p><br> <p>Powerful Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr also called on fighters loyal to him to be on alert to protect Baghdad. Shi'ite militias like Sadr's 'Peace Brigades' were seen as a bulwark against Islamic State's sweeping advance in 2014 which threatened Iraq's capital and its most sacred Shi'ite shrines.</p><br> <p><em></em></p> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\">terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p><br><br><br><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247393091194/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de92025/sc/13/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247393091194/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de92025/sc/13/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"></a><br><br><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247393091194/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de92025/sc/13/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247393091194/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de92025/sc/13/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"></a><br><br><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247393091194/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de92025/sc/13/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247393091194/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de92025/sc/13/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"></a><br><br><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247393091194/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de92025/sc/13/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247393091194/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de92025/sc/13/a2.img\" border=\"0\"></a><br><a href=\"http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/247393091194/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de92025/sc/13/ach.htm\"><img src=\"http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/247393091194/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de92025/sc/13/ach.img\" border=\"0\"></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/247393091194/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de92025/sc/13/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi2.feedsportal.com/r/247393091194/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de92025/sc/13/a2t2.img\" border=\"0\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.huffingtonpost.com/c/35496/f/677538/s/4de92025/sc/13/mf.gif\" border=\"0\">",

                    "content": "<br> <p>New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) had trouble on Sunday explaining his decision to\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-christie-donald-trump_us_56d0902ee4b0bf0dab31ebad\">endorse Donald Trump's candidacy</a>\u00a0for president in light of his past differences with the Republican front-runner.</p><br> <p>On ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d George Stephanopoulos asked Christie question after question about his previous criticism of Trump. Whether it was Trump\u2019s plan to get Mexico to pay for a wall along the United States\u2019 southern border or his pledge to protect Social Security from cuts, Christie struggled to come up with plausible reasons for supporting a candidate whose positions he once opposed so passionately.</p><br> <p>It was a cringe-inducing performance from a governor whose presidential campaign slogan was \"telling it like it is.\"</p><br> <h4>1. Getting Mexico to pay for the border wall.</h4><br> <p>Stephanopoulos played a video clip from the campaign trail in which Christie questioned how Trump would get Mexico to build the border wall.</p><br> <p>\u201cI tell everybody who goes to a Donald Trump event, if he gets asked a question, just ask him how,\u201d Christie said at the time. \u201cFirst, he says he&#39;s going to build a wall across the entire border between the United States and Mexico. How? How is he going to make the Mexicans pay for the wall? How? They are a sovereign nation.\u201d</p><br> <p>Christie said he now believes Trump is capable of convincing Mexico to do it,\u00a0and that Trump has enough time before the election to \u201canswer\u201d how he would accomplish that goal.\u00a0</p><br> <p>\"You know, George, this is a February -- this is February of a campaign,\" he said.</p><br> <blockquote><br> <span>You know, George, this is a February -- this is February of a campaign.</span><br> <span>New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R)</span><br> </blockquote><br> <br> <p>Stephanopoulos pressed Christie, noting that the presidential campaign has been under way for eight months.</p><br> <p>Christie vaguely offered that Trump would get it done through \u201cdiplomacy and other tools,\u201d and emphasized the real estate mogul\u2019s \u201cstrong leadership.\u201d</p><br> <p>\u201cStrong leadership is able to exert those things and be able to talk to folks about what advantages and disadvantages are of certain policies,\u201d Christie said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is that there won&#39;t be any question about Mr. Trump&#39;s strength and his resoluteness in terms of getting the things done that he&#39;s wanted to get done.\u201d</p><br> <p>When Stephanopoulos did not let up, pushing Christie to offer specific ways Trump could realize his goal,\u00a0Christie finally settled on the prospect of leveraging the U.S.\u2019 trading relationship with Mexico.</p><br> <p>\u201cListen, I think what he&#39;s talked about is the trade relationship and working on the trade relationship and he talked about that yesterday,\u201d Christie said. \u201cAnd using that as a lever to get them to do things on immigration.\u201d</p><br> <br> <h4>2. Not cutting Social Security.</h4><br> <p>Stephanopoulos went on to ask Christie what he thought of Trump\u2019s opposition to cutting Social Security benefits, something Christie had openly embraced in his straight talk-themed presidential run. The host played another clip of Christie on the stump mocking Trump\u2019s promise not to cut the popular social insurance program.\u00a0</p><br> <p>\u201cI think that we need to do something on Social Security,\u201d Christie told the host. \u201cAnd I&#39;ve made that really clear. And so listen, Donald Trump and I are not going to agree on every issue.\u201d</p><br> <p>Stephanopoulos again asked for a better explanation, saying Christie\u2019s support for cutting benefits for future beneficiaries was the \u201csignature issue\u201d of his campaign.</p><br> <p>\u201cIt&#39;s not the signature issue of my campaign,\u201d Christie retorted. \u201cThe signature issue of my campaign was national security, keeping America safe and secure from terrorist attacks and making us a better ally and neighbor around the world.\u201d</p><br> <p>Christie even argued that Trump\u2019s plan was no less fantastical than the other Republican candidates&#39;.</p><br> <p>\u201cThe fact of the matter is, though, when you look up on that stage, no one else has a plan on Social Security, George,\u201d Christie said.</p><br> <p>\u201cWhat I&#39;m saying is that he&#39;s going to give more complete answers as time goes on on these issues,\u201d he added. \u201cLet&#39;s hold every candidate to that same standard.\u201d</p><br> <blockquote><br> <span>What I'm saying is that he's going to give more complete answers as time goes on on these issues.</span><br> <span>New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R)</span><br> </blockquote><br> <br> <p>In fact, Trump\u2019s top rivals for the GOP nomination, Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) both have plans to alter Social Security that are more detailed -- and more closely resemble what Christie had proposed as a candidate -- than anything Trump has put forward.</p><br> <p>Rubio <a href=\"https://marcorubio.com/issues-2/marco-rubio-social-security-medicare-plan/\">would raise</a> the retirement age for claiming full benefits above 67 --\u00a0something that is already scheduled to happen --\u00a0reduce benefits for \u201cupper-income\u201d seniors and adopt a more modest cost-of-living adjustment.</p><br> <p>Cruz has embraced similar proposals and gone further, <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/ted-cruz-social-security-privatization\">expressing support</a> for partial privatization of the program.</p><br> <p>Trump, by contrast, <a href=\"http://info.msnbc.com/_news/2016/02/17/35127534-full-transcript-msnbcs-town-hall-with-donald-trump?lite\">has said</a> he would close Social Security\u2019s funding gap without cutting benefits by growing the economy and cracking down on \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse.\u201d</p><br> <p>The\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aarp-social-security-campaign_us_56c3854fe4b0c3c55052e81e\">AARP says</a>\u00a0Trump is the one candidate in the presidential race -- in either party -- who has yet to lay out a concrete plan for the program.</p><br> <div><br> <div><blockquote align=\"center\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Thx <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcorubio\">@marcorubio</a> for thanking <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AARPSC\">@AARPSC</a> for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TakeAStand?src=hash\">#TakeAStand</a> on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SocialSecurity?src=hash\">#SocialSecurity</a> &amp; for sharing ur plan at rally <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SCPolitics?src=hash\">#SCPolitics</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/tZ6nj6XTYq\">pic.twitter.com/tZ6nj6XTYq</a></p>\u2014 Pete Jeffries (@petejeffries) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/petejeffries/status/700348667522367488\">February 18, 2016</a></blockquote><br> </div></div><br> <br> <h4>3. Banning Muslims from entering the country</h4><br> <p>The difficult questions did not stop there for Christie. Christie was at pains to explain how he reconciled his apparent disagreement with Trump\u2019s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States with his current backing of the candidate.</p><br> <p>He first insisted that because Trump had modified his proposed ban to exclude U.S. citizens, it was now acceptable.</p><br> <p>Then he argued the ban was less important than Trump\u2019s \u201coverall\u201d tough stance on national security, which was evident in his support for mass surveillance, a \u201cstronger\u201d military and the police.</p><br> <p>\u201cMr. Trump has talked about the idea of making sure we restore NSA authority, he&#39;s -- which some people in this race have not been in favor of, like Senator Cruz,\u201d Christie said. \u201cHe has stood up and said that he wants to make our military stronger, which we need to do. He&#39;s stood up for law enforcement in ways that other candidates in this race have not done.\u201d</p><br> <br> <h4>4. Accusing New Jersey Muslims of celebrating Sept. 11.</h4><br> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Christie </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> was again caught flat-footed when Stephanopoulos asked whether Trump\u2019s claim he saw Muslim Americans in New Jersey celebrating the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks was a \u201cslander\u201d of Christie\u2019s constituents.</span></p><br> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">\u201cI don&#39;t think he means it as that at all, as a slander of my state&#39;s citizens,\u201d Christie sputtered. \u201cWhat I think, though, is when I say he&#39;s -- can be trusted, this is a guy who, when he makes promises, he keeps them. Um, and I&#39;ve seen that over the course of a 14-year relationship with him.\u201d</span></p><br> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Christie\u2019s embrace of Trump is notable since, as a presidential candidate, he specifically spoke out against judging all Muslim Americans for the actions of a few extremists. At one New Hampshire campaign appearance, Christie </span><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-christie-anti-muslim-bigotry-video_us_566ed7d3e4b011b83a6bcd90\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">touted</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> his nomination of Sohail Mohammed, who is Muslim, as a judge in New Jersey, and his outreach to the state\u2019s large Muslim population.</span></p><br> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Several times on Sunday, Christie gave up trying to explain his support for Trump\u2019s policies, talking up his electability instead.</span></p><br> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">\u201cGiven the other options on the stage, let me tell you something, he&#39;s the strongest, best guy to be our nominee to beat Hillary Clinton and to be the next president of the United States,\u201d he concluded.</span></p> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\">terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p><br><br><br><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392999060/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de8c9e8/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392999060/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de8c9e8/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"></a><br><br><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392999060/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de8c9e8/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392999060/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de8c9e8/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"></a><br><br><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392999060/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de8c9e8/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392999060/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de8c9e8/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"></a><br><br><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247392999060/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de8c9e8/sc/7/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247392999060/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de8c9e8/sc/7/a2.img\" border=\"0\"></a><br><a href=\"http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/247392999060/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de8c9e8/sc/7/ach.htm\"><img src=\"http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/247392999060/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de8c9e8/sc/7/ach.img\" border=\"0\"></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/247392999060/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de8c9e8/sc/7/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi2.feedsportal.com/r/247392999060/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de8c9e8/sc/7/a2t2.img\" border=\"0\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.huffingtonpost.com/c/35496/f/677538/s/4de8c9e8/sc/7/mf.gif\" border=\"0\">",

                    "content": "<br> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">WASHINGTON -- Hillary Clinton had a great night on Saturday. The Democratic Party had a terrible one.</span></p><br> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Clinton trounced Sen. Bernie Sanders by nearly 3-to-1 in the South Carolina primary, winning every single county in the state. The thumping followed a convincing Clinton victory in the Nevada caucuses less than a week earlier, and sets the stage for a strong showing for Clinton on Super Tuesday, when 11 states are in play. </span></p><br> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">For the Democratic Party establishment, these wins are being interpreted as a sign that the universe is back in order, after a 74-year-old democratic socialist from Vermont had seemingly knocked everything out of orbit. Party leaders long ago picked Clinton as their standard-bearer for 2016 and worked to clear the field of potential primary challengers. When Sanders began closing on Clinton in national polls and clobbered her in New Hampshire, the establishment bet was starting to look shaky. Had they lost touch with the core concerns of the party's base? After South Carolina, Sanders' chances to secure an upset nomination are dwindling.</span></p><br> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/27/us/elections/south-carolina-democrat-poll.html?_r=0\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Exit polling</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> showed that Clinton won every demographic tracked except voters under 30. Even here, she was far more competitive with Sanders than in prior contests, losing just 54 percent to 46 percent. She even won a higher share of the black vote than Barack Obama did in 2008.</span></p><br> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">But Democratic Party elites shouldn't be high-fiving each other. They should be very, very worried. </span></p><br> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In primary after primary this cycle, Democratic voters just aren't showing up. Only 367,491 people cast a ballot for either Clinton or Sanders on Saturday. That's down 16 percent from the 436,219 people who came out in 2008 for Clinton and Obama. Factor in the 93,522 people who voted for John Edwards back in the day, and you can see the scope of the problem. Democrats in 2016 are only getting about two-thirds of the primary votes that they received eight years ago.</span></p><br> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Republican turnout in the South Carolina primary, by contrast, was up more than 70 percent from 2008.</span></p><br> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">South Carolina's turnout numbers are not an anomaly. They're consistent with other primaries to date. Republicans are psyched. Democrats are demoralized. </span></p><br> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Presidential elections increasingly hinge on each party's ability to turn out the faithful. There simply are </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/01/11/independents-outnumber-democrats-and-republicans-but-theyre-not-very-independent/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">not many</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> truly independent voters who cast their ballots for different parties in different cycles. A big chunk of voters who identify as independents do so not because they cherish a moderate middle ground between two parties, but because they see their own party as </span><a href=\"http://cookpolitical.com/story/6608\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">insufficiently committed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> to its ideological principles. In this era, lousy primary turnout spells big trouble for the general election.</span></p><br> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The poor Democratic turnout figures are not an indictment of Clinton alone. Maybe the DNC&#39;s decision to bury the party&#39;s debates on weekends and holidays helped Republicans generate more early enthusiasm with primetime coverage.\u00a0And part of Sanders&#39; pitch, of course, is his insistence that progressive energy will bring out high numbers of enthusiastic voters that an old party insider just can&#39;t compete with. It&#39;s a good pitch. But so far, it isn&#39;t happening.</span></p><br> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">It's always hard to motivate voters for four more years of the same old thing after getting eight years of it -- especially when many of those years were mired in an awful recession, followed by a weak economic recovery. Opposition parties typically have a better hand after eight years. That's why 12-year runs in the presidency by a single party don't happen very often.</span></p><br> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">If Republicans nominate Donald Trump for president -- and barring a cataclysm or a coup, they will -- there will be plenty of energized Democrats who turn out in the general election for no other reason than to cast a ballot against a billionaire who has predicated his campaign on raw bigotry.</span></p><br> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">That will help even the energy some. But the flip side of the coin is that lots of angry white people will show up to vote for Trump. We know because they're already doing so in the primaries. And a lot of Republican partisans who prefer other candidates still care more about turning the page on the Obama era than they do about Trump's flirtations with fascism (and even, at times, liberal critiques of GOP orthodoxy).</span></p><br> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Trump's overtly racist campaign makes it hard to see how he wins Western swing states like Nevada or New Mexico that have high numbers of Latino voters. But his economic pitch to the white working class holds obvious appeal in traditional Democratic strongholds in the upper Midwest -- communities that have been ravaged by the past three decades of U.S. economic policy. Even if Trump lost every other swing state in the country, turning the Rust Belt red would be enough for him to win the Electoral College.</span></p><br> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">That's a difficult maneuver. But it's time to start worrying about </span><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-donald-trump-becomes-president_us_56cb5429e4b0928f5a6c9ead\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">President Trump</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">.</span></p><br> <p><strong><em>Zach Carter is a co-host of the HuffPost Politics podcast &quot;So, That Happened.&quot;\u00a0</em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/so-that-happened/id945384774?mt=2\"><em>Subscribe here</em></a><em> or listen to the latest episode below:</em>\u00a0</strong></p><br> <div><br> <div></div></div><br> <br> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\">terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p><br><br><br><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392998335/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de8c6c2/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392998335/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de8c6c2/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"></a><br><br><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392998335/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de8c6c2/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392998335/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de8c6c2/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"></a><br><br><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392998335/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de8c6c2/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392998335/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de8c6c2/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"></a><br><br><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247392998335/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de8c6c2/sc/7/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247392998335/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de8c6c2/sc/7/a2.img\" border=\"0\"></a><br><a href=\"http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/247392998335/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de8c6c2/sc/7/ach.htm\"><img src=\"http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/247392998335/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de8c6c2/sc/7/ach.img\" border=\"0\"></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/247392998335/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de8c6c2/sc/7/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi2.feedsportal.com/r/247392998335/u/31/f/677538/c/35496/s/4de8c6c2/sc/7/a2t2.img\" border=\"0\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.huffingtonpost.com/c/35496/f/677538/s/4de8c6c2/sc/7/mf.gif\" border=\"0\">",
